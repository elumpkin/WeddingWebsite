        We've been fluttering around each other for a good portion of our lives. Growing up on oppositite sides of the highway,
        going to the same movie theaters, shopping at the same stores, and driving down the same roads.
    </br></br>
        We lived just two miles away from each other at that point. I just started my senior year of undergrad at Texas A&M's 
        business school and he started his first year at the med school. No doubt, we passed each other dozens of times 
        in our nearest HEB surveying produce.
    </br></br>

        But, ultimately, it took a finely tuned algorithim marking us 96% compatible, a misguided implication that the fourth season of Community
        wasn't worth forgetting about completely, and an encouraging roommate to bring us together.

            After two and a half years of being together, two of which long distance, we took a 
            trip to New York to catch Broadway shows, stare directly into brightly lit billboards,
            and gorge ourselves on culinary delights.  
        </br></br>
            He told me that he managed to snag a table at the only Michelin Star rated vegatarian resturaunt.
            Deciding to be casual that night, I bought a dress and heels, had my makeup professionally done, and made a wish to any devine entity for my hair.
            But before dinner, he wanted to take a tour of the Cartier Mansion since we missed our chance on our previous visit.
        </br></br>
            We were guided through three floors, each with large rooms dedicated to specific jewlery and people. One room, watches, dedicated to Andy Worhol due to his obsession with his Cartier Tank. 
            Next, the fine diamonds room, dedicated to Elizabeth Taylor due to her iconic ruby and diamond necklace. Finally, the Princess Salon, which housed all of the engagment and 
            wedding rings, dedicated to the Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly, due to her love of her engagment ring.
        </br></br>
        Each picture and office inspiration within the salon was explained to us with great historical detail.
        </br></br>
        Never in my life had I been more regretful that I'd worn five inch stillettos.
        </br></br>
        Luckily for me, the salon was the last stop in our tour. The final room was closed off with Cartier red velvet curtains. 
        Our guide smiled and led us into the room with two seats and two glasses of wine awaiting us. 
        </br></br>
        At last, this was it! A place to sit, with  wine at that!
        </br></br>
        We took our seats, he took my hands, he took a knee, then he took my breath.
